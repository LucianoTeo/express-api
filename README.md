## What am I doing here? (WIP)
This a node/expressJS api server that I am developing to use as a template for upcoming projects.

### This API has only the necessary dependencies 
Start a API development with my current tech-stack without having to worry about initial configs such as:
  - [x] Typescript
  - [ ] ESlint + Prettier
  - [ ] Swagger
  - [ ] Jest + Cypress
  - [ ] Mail provider
  - [x] Prisma
  - [x] Global Error handling
  - [x] System Design (SOLID)
  - [x] User Authentication & Authorization (JWT)
  - [ ] Password recovery
  - [ ] Middlewares (SUPER & Authenticated)
  - [ ] Docker compose with DockerFiles (PostgreSQL and api services)

Follow the instructions below to run the project locally
```js
  git clone 
```

Run Docker command
```js
  sudo docker compose up
```

Run the app
```js
  npm run start:dev
```

Run unit tests
```js
  npm run test:unit
```

Run E2E tests
```js
  npm run test:e2e
```
<br />
Production mode
